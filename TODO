Convert to use as much existing infra-structure as possible:

	- drop t1lib
	- use fontconfig
	- dont use /etc/xpdf.rc, add abstraction that can work with
	  GNOME and KDE configuration systems (GConf and ?)
	- improve cairo backend

Maybe:

	- Install poppler-splash and poppler-cairo to indicate
	  available backends.  Alternatively, just hide the backend
	  choice from the application.

	- make c-wrapper so GNOME projects won't need to use C++ (no
	  glib, just a plain c wrapper so you can compile against and
	  link to it using only C tools)

Done:
	- rename GString etc in goo lib to make it more glib friendly
	- make splash optional
