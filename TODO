Convert to use as much existing infra-structure as possible:
	- drop t1lib
	- use fontconfig
	- dont use /etc/xpdf.rc, add abstraction that can work with
	  GNOME and KDE configuration systems (GConf and ?)
	- improve cairo backend
	- use jasper for jpeg2000 decoding
	- use littlecms for color management?
	- use libtiff for ccitt decoding?

Performance:
	- make color space conversion stuff more sane (right now we
	  hack around some of it in the cairo backend)
	- move away from getChar to a more read(2) like interface

Maybe:
	- Install poppler-splash.pc and poppler-cairo.pc to indicate
	  available backends.  Alternatively, just hide the backend
	  choice from the application.  This is done now, but for this
	  to work properly, we really need multiple .so's.

	- make c-wrapper so GNOME projects won't need to use C++ (no
	  glib, just a plain c wrapper so you can compile against and
	  link to it using only C tools)

Done:
	- rename GString etc in goo lib to make it more glib friendly
	- make splash optional
